# Define Role-Based Access Control Using Elasticsearch Security

With Elasticsearch Security, you can create highly granular roles to permit or restrict access to specific indexes, documents, and fields. Follow along on the Linux Academy Cloud Playground servers as we demonstrate how to:

- Use Kibana's management UI to create roles and users
- Use Elasticsearch APIs to create roles and users
- Limit access to specific cluster permissions
- Limit access to specific indexes
- Only allow specific actions on indexes
- Create a user with a given set of roles
