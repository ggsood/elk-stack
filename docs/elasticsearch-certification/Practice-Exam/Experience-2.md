Before entering the exam questions formally, there will be an explanation of the exam questions and a description of the cluster situation. My environment is three clusters, the first one is three nodes, the other two are one node, and each cluster comes with a kibana. There are a total of 10 questions in my test, and I will only briefly describe the test sites:

- Cold and hot separation architecture configuration
- update_by_query + script updates the index as required
- Custom word segmentation plug-in, so that king's and kings have the same score
- Nested type and nested query
- dynamic mapping
- multi-match, boost, most_fields
- date-histogram, sub-aggregation
- Open security
- Cluster backup snapshot
- match_phrase, hightlighting, sort
