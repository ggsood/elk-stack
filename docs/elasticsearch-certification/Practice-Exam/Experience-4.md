When I took the test, I assigned 10 questions. I introduced these test sites in a less professional way, including

- Basic security module and RBAC,
- Cluster management makes the shards that are not green -> green (change the number of copies),
- hot/warm cluster architecture (equivalent to index-level shard allocation, officially called routing),
- Shard allocation at the instance level (one elasticsearch process and one instance),
- reindex+script,
- snapshot,
- update_by_query+pipeline,
- ingest,
- template,
- Custom analysis (to figure out the functions of text segmentation, text filtering, and character filtering),
- mapping (set data type according to conditions),
- Paging query, highlight (custom highlight label), sorting,
- Three ways of aggregation.
