# **Welcome to Learning Elastic Stack a.k.a ELK Stack**

Hi, I am Gaurav Sood, working as a DevOps Engineer I frequently use a lot of tools and technologies as part of my work.

One of the technologies I work on daily basis and is greatly impressed by is the Elasticsearch Logstash and Kibana Stack also known as ELK Stack.

To be honest I am just an average person learning stuff everyday and want to learn them in a manner that lasts longs and can be easily shared.

I am starting this website as a part of learning the Elasticsearch which will help in getting the basics clear and have real life examples of the various use cases.

So starting with this thought in mind lets get started into what is Elasticsearch.

I have kept my to my best efforts to stick as close to the official Elasticsearch documentation in case of any issues you see here
you can refer to the docs at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html
