# Welcome to Learning Elastic Stack a.k.a ELK Stack

Hi, I am Gaurav Sood, working as a DevOps Engineer I frequently use a lot of tools and technologies as part of my work.

One of the technologies I work on daily basis and is greatly impressed by is the Elasticsearch Stack also known as ELK Stack.

To be honest I am just an average person learning stuff everyday and want to learn them in a manner that lasts longs and can be easily taught.

I am starting this website as a part of learning the Elasticsearch which will help in getting the basics clear and have some real life examples of the various use cases.

So starting with this thought in mind lets get started into what is Elasticsearch.
