What this means is there is a slight latency (normally one second) from the time you index a document until the time it becomes searchable. Cluster A cluster is a collection of one or more nodes (servers) that together holds your entire data and provides federated indexing and search capabilities across all nodes. A cluster is identified by a unique name which by default is \"elasticsearch\". This name is important because a node can only be part of a cluster if the node is set up to join the cluster by its name. Make sure that you don\u2019t reuse the same cluster names in different environments, otherwise you might end up with nodes joining the wrong cluster. For instance you could use logging-dev, logging-stage, and logging-prod for the development, staging, and production clusters. Node A node is a single server that is part of your cluster, stores your data, and participates in the cluster\u2019s indexing and search capabilities. Just like a cluster, a node is identified by a name which by default is a random Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) that is assigned to the node at startup. You can define any node name you want if you do not want the default. This name is important for administration purposes where you want to identify which servers in your network correspond to which nodes in your Elasticsearch cluster. A node can be configured to join a specific cluster by the cluster name. By default, each node is set up to join a cluster named elasticsearch which means that if you start up a number of nodes on your network and\u2014assuming they can discover each other\u2014they will all automatically form and join a single cluster named elasticsearch. Index An index is a collection of documents that have somewhat similar characteristics. An index is identified by a name (that must be all lowercase) and this name is used to refer to the index when performing indexing, search, update, and delete operations against the documents in it. Type - Depreceated A type used to be a logical category/partition of your index to allow you to store different types of documents in the same index, e.g. one type for users, another type for blog posts. Reason - fields that have the same name in different mapping types are backed by the same Lucene field internally. This can lead to frustration when, for example, you want deleted to be a date field in one type and a boolean field in another type in the same index. On top of that, storing different entities that have few or no fields in common in the same index leads to sparse data and interferes with Lucene\u2019s ability to compress documents efficiently. Alternatives- 1. index per document type This approach has two benefits: Data is more likely to be dense and so benefit from compression techniques used in Lucene. The term statistics used for scoring in full text search are more likely to be accurate because all documents in the same index represent a single entity. custom type PUT twitter { \"mappings\" : { \"_doc\" : { \"properties\" : { \"type\" : { \"type\" : \"keyword\" } , \"name\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" } , \"user_name\" : { \"type\" : \"keyword\" } , \"email\" : { \"type\" : \"keyword\" } , \"content\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" } , \"tweeted_at\" : { \"type\" : \"date\" } } } } } The explicit type field takes the place of the implicit _type field .

This document is expressed in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) which is a ubiquitous internet data interchange format. Shards and Replicas - Subdivide your index into multiple pieces called shards. When you create an index, you can simply define the number of shards that you want. Each shard is in itself a fully-functional and independent \"index\" that can be hosted on any node in the cluster. Sharding is important for two primary reasons: It allows you to horizontally split/scale your content volume It allows you to distribute and parallelize operations across shards (potentially on multiple nodes) thus increasing performance/throughput. Elasticsearch allows you to make one or more copies of your index\u2019s shards into what are called replica shards, or replicas for short. Replication is important for two primary reasons: It provides high availability in case a shard/node fails. For this reason, it is important to note that a replica shard is never allocated on the same node as the original/primary shard that it was copied from. It allows you to scale out your search volume/throughput since searches can be executed on all replicas in parallel. The number of shards and replicas can be defined per index at the time the index is created. After the index is created, you may also change the number of replicas dynamically anytime. You can change the number of shards for an existing index using the _shrink and _split APIs, however this is not a trivial task and pre-planning for the correct number of shards is the optimal approach. Each Elasticsearch shard is a Lucene index. There is a maximum number of documents you can have in a single Lucene index. As of LUCENE-5843, the limit is 2,147,483,519 (= Integer.MAX_VALUE - 128) documents. You can monitor shard sizes using the _cat/shards API.","title":"Basic Concepts"},{"location":"elasticsearch/Basic-Concepts/#elasticsearch-basic-concepts-and-terms","text":"","title":"Elasticsearch Basic Concepts and Terms"},{"location":"elasticsearch/Basic-Concepts/#near-real-time","text":"Elasticsearch is a near-realtime search platform.

But Lucene is just a library. To leverage its power, you need to work in Java and need to integrate Lucene directly with your application. Lucene is very complex and this approach is time and resource consuming. Elasticsearch, written in Java uses Lucene internally for all of its indexing and searching, it aims to make full-text search easy by hiding the complexities of Lucene behind a simple, coherent, RESTful API. However Elasticsearch is more then \"just\" full-text search. It can also be described as follows: - A distributed near real-time document store where every field is indexed and searchable. - A distributed search engine with real-time analytics - Capable of scaling to hundreds of servers and petabytes of structured and unstructured data Moreover it packages up all this functionality into a standalone server that any application can talk to via a simple RESTful API , using any webclient or just cli. RESTful API with JSON over HTTP All languages can communicate with Elasticsearch over port 9200 using a RESTful API, accessible with your favorite web client or just curl command. A request to Elasticsearch consists of the same parts as any HTTP request: curl -X<VERB> '<PROTOCOL>://<HOST>/<PATH>?<QUERY_STRING>' -d '<BODY>' where VERB : The appropriate HTTP method or verb: GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, or DELETE. PROTOCOL : Either http or https HOST : The hostname of any node in your Elasticsearch cluster, or localhost for a node on your local machine. PORT : The port running the Elasticsearch HTTP service, which defaults to 9200. QUERY_STRING : Any optional query-string parameters BODY : A JSON-encoded request body Example - to count the number of documents in the cluster curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_count?pretty' -d ' { \"query\": { \"match_all\": {} } }' Document Oriented Elasticsearch is document oriented, meaning that it stores entire objects or documents. It not only stores them, but also indexes the contents of each document in order to make them searchable. In Elasticsearch, you index, search, sort, and filter documents \u2014 not rows of columnar data. Elasticsearch uses JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON , as the serialization format for documents. JSON serialization is supported by most programming languages, and has become the standard format used by the NoSQL movement. Finding your feet Lets start with a simple tutorial covering basics concepts like indexing, search and aggregations. We will cover more on them in next sections. Have a running instance of Elasticsearch running, single node cluster will be good, for details you can refer this link . Index some documents PUT /customer/_doc/1 { \"name\" : \"John Doe\" } This request automatically creates the customer index if it doesn\u2019t already exist, adds a new document that has an ID of 1, and stores and indexes the name field. The new document is available immediately from any node in the cluster. You can retrieve it with a GET request that specifies its document ID. GET /customer/_doc/1 You can also load documents in bulk by following steps- Download the accounts.json sample data set. Index the account data into the bank index with the following _bulk request: curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -XPOST \"localhost:9200/bank/_bulk?pretty&refresh\" --data-binary \"@accounts.json\" curl \"localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v\" The response indicates that 1,000 documents were indexed successfully. Start Searching Once you have ingested some data into an Elasticsearch index, you can search it by sending requests to the _search endpoint. - To access the full suite of search capabilities, you use the Elasticsearch Query DSL to specify the search criteria in the request body. - You specify the name of the index you want to search in the request URI. GET /bank/_search { \"query\" : { \"match_all\" : {} } , \"sort\" : [ { \"account_number\" : \"asc\" } ] } Each search request is self-contained : Elasticsearch does not maintain any state information across requests. To page through the search hits, specify the from and size parameters in your request. For example, the following request gets hits 10 through 19: GET /bank/_search { \"query\" : { \"match_all\" : {} } , \"sort\" : [ { \"account_number\" : \"asc\" } ] , \"from\" : 10 , \"size\" : 10 } Full-Text Search - the following request only matches addresses that contain the phrase mill lane GET /bank/_search { \"query\" : { \"match_phrase\" : { \"address\" : \"mill lane\" } } } Analytics Elasticsearch aggregations enable you to get meta-information about your search results and answer questions like, \"How many account holders are in Texas?\" or \"What\u2019s the average balance of accounts in Tennessee?\" You can search documents, filter hits, and use aggregations to analyze the results all in one request. GET /bank/_search { \"size\" : 0 , \"aggs\" : { \"group_by_state\" : { \"terms\" : { \"field\" : \"state.keyword\" } } } } Next Steps Now that you\u2019ve set up a cluster, indexed some documents, and run some searches and aggregations, time to dig inside elasticsearch more in the next sections.","title":"You Know for Search"},{"location":"elasticsearch/YouKnowForSearch/#you-know-for-search","text":"Elasticsearch is an open-source search engine built on top of Apache Lucene, a fulltext search-engine library.

Elasticsearch, written in Java uses Lucene internally for all of its indexing and searching, it aims to make full-text search easy by hiding the complexities of Lucene behind a simple, coherent, RESTful API. However Elasticsearch is more then \"just\" full-text search. It can also be described as follows: - A distributed near real-time document store where every field is indexed and searchable. - A distributed search engine with real-time analytics - Capable of scaling to hundreds of servers and petabytes of structured and unstructured data Moreover it packages up all this functionality into a standalone server that any application can talk to via a simple RESTful API , using any webclient or just cli.","title":"You Know, for Search"},{"location":"elasticsearch/YouKnowForSearch/#restful-api-with-json-over-http","text":"All languages can communicate with Elasticsearch over port 9200 using a RESTful API, accessible with your favorite web client or just curl command. A request to Elasticsearch consists of the same parts as any HTTP request: curl -X<VERB> '<PROTOCOL>://<HOST>/<PATH>?<QUERY_STRING>' -d '<BODY>' where VERB : The appropriate HTTP method or verb: GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, or DELETE. PROTOCOL : Either http or https HOST : The hostname of any node in your Elasticsearch cluster, or localhost for a node on your local machine. PORT : The port running the Elasticsearch HTTP service, which defaults to 9200. QUERY_STRING : Any optional query-string parameters BODY : A JSON-encoded request body Example - to count the number of documents in the cluster curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_count?pretty' -d ' { \"query\": { \"match_all\": {} } }'","title":"RESTful API with JSON over HTTP"},{"location":"elasticsearch/YouKnowForSearch/#document-oriented","text":"Elasticsearch is document oriented, meaning that it stores entire objects or documents. It not only stores them, but also indexes the contents of each document in order to make them searchable. In Elasticsearch, you index, search, sort, and filter documents \u2014 not rows of columnar data. Elasticsearch uses JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON , as the serialization format for documents. JSON serialization is supported by most programming languages, and has become the standard format used by the NoSQL movement.","title":"Document Oriented"},{"location":"elasticsearch/YouKnowForSearch/#finding-your-feet","text":"Lets start with a simple tutorial covering basics concepts like indexing, search and aggregations.

The new document is available immediately from any node in the cluster. You can retrieve it with a GET request that specifies its document ID. GET /customer/_doc/1 You can also load documents in bulk by following steps- Download the accounts.json sample data set. Index the account data into the bank index with the following _bulk request: curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -XPOST \"localhost:9200/bank/_bulk?pretty&refresh\" --data-binary \"@accounts.json\" curl \"localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v\" The response indicates that 1,000 documents were indexed successfully.","title":"Index some documents"},{"location":"elasticsearch/YouKnowForSearch/#start-searching","text":"Once you have ingested some data into an Elasticsearch index, you can search it by sending requests to the _search endpoint. - To access the full suite of search capabilities, you use the Elasticsearch Query DSL to specify the search criteria in the request body. - You specify the name of the index you want to search in the request URI. GET /bank/_search { \"query\" : { \"match_all\" : {} } , \"sort\" : [ { \"account_number\" : \"asc\" } ] } Each search request is self-contained : Elasticsearch does not maintain any state information across requests. To page through the search hits, specify the from and size parameters in your request. For example, the following request gets hits 10 through 19: GET /bank/_search { \"query\" : { \"match_all\" : {} } , \"sort\" : [ { \"account_number\" : \"asc\" } ] , \"from\" : 10 , \"size\" : 10 } Full-Text Search - the following request only matches addresses that contain the phrase mill lane GET /bank/_search { \"query\" : { \"match_phrase\" : { \"address\" : \"mill lane\" } } }","title":"Start Searching"},{"location":"elasticsearch/YouKnowForSearch/#analytics","text":"Elasticsearch aggregations enable you to get meta-information about your search results and answer questions like, \"How many account holders are in Texas?\" or \"What\u2019s the average balance of accounts in Tennessee?\" You can search documents, filter hits, and use aggregations to analyze the results all in one request.
